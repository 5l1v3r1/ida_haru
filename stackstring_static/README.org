* stackstring_static.py - IDAPython script statically-recovering strings constructed in stack

The motivation is the same as [[https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/08/flare-ida-pro-script-series-automatic-recovery-of-constructed-strings-in-malware.html][FireEye FLARE script]], but I implemented it statically without Vivisect a few years ago.

Note: the script internally renames the stack variables so manually-renamed info in the function will be lost
